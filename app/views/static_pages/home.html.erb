            <h3>Request to Participate in Research</h3>

            <p>Thank you for your interest in my research. We would like to invite you to participate in a session designed analyze nuclear force structures at various arsenal sizes. The session includes online responses to survey questions and use of a computer tool. The survey questions should take about 15 minutes to complete and the analysis of nuclear arsenals using the computer tool should take about 50 minutes. The complete session should take about 90 minutes.</p>

            <p>I hope you're participating in this this study because you are interested in nuclear weapons policy. Your participation could improve our understanding of how we can maintain strategic deterrence in differing future conditions. <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate.</strong></p>
